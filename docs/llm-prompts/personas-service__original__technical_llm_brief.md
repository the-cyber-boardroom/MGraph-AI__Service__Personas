## Overview and Objectives

The **Personas Service** (to be deployed at `personas.prod.mgraph.ai`)
is a stateless microservice that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
to **translate and tailor content for specific target personas**. The
core idea is to adapt a given message or query so that it is optimally
communicated **to or from a particular persona**, taking into account
that persona's language, background knowledge, role, and communication
style. This service enables dynamic "persona-aware" translations without
training custom models -- it uses existing LLMs via our LLM backend
service (e.g. `llms.prod.mgraph.ai`) for all natural language
generation.

**Key objectives include:**

-   **Effective Communication to Any Persona:** Automatically rephrase
    or summarize information in a way that a target persona (with
    specific role, expertise, culture, or language) will easily
    understand and find relevant. For example, explaining a
    cybersecurity incident in business terms for an executive versus in
    technical terms for an IT specialist.

-   **Persona-Specific Responses:** Allow users to interact with an LLM
    **as a given persona**, meaning the LLM will respond *in the voice
    or perspective of that persona*. This is useful for simulations
    (e.g. "What would a CISO say about this risk?") or for generating
    content with a consistent persona voice.

-   **No Model Training Required:** We will **not create or fine-tune
    any new ML models**. The service will rely on prompt engineering and
    the existing LLM infrastructure. This keeps implementation
    lightweight and focuses on orchestration rather than ML development.

-   **Stateless Microservice Architecture:** The service will be
    stateless -- it will not maintain session data or persona state
    between requests. Each request contains all necessary inputs
    (persona definition and content), and the service simply returns the
    LLM result. Stateless design is aligned with scalability best
    practices for LLM microservices, as *"LLM inference is fundamentally
    stateless --- each request can be processed
    independently"*[\[1\]](https://dzone.com/articles/reliable-llm-microservices-kubernetes-aws#:~:text=).
    This makes horizontal scaling and AWS deployment (e.g. Lambda or
    containers) simpler and more robust.

-   **Persona Management:** Provide a mechanism to create, edit, and
    manage persona definitions (likely as JSON objects) that capture how
    to communicate with or as that persona. Personas can be defined,
    stored, and retrieved on demand, enabling reuse across requests. We
    will also explore an LLM-assisted method to generate persona
    definitions from high-level descriptions to streamline the creation
    of new personas.

By achieving these objectives, the Personas Service will function as a
flexible "persona translator" -- bridging the gap between different
knowledge domains, languages, and communication styles, ensuring the
right message gets across to the right audience. In essence, it lets
developers and systems **translate a message for a target persona, or
generate a response as if from a target persona, on the fly**.

## Persona Definition Schema

At the heart of this service is the **Persona Definition** -- a data
structure that describes the key attributes of a persona. This
definition guides the LLM in adjusting tone, terminology, and detail
level for that persona.

A Persona Definition will likely be represented in JSON (or a similar
structured format) and could include fields such as:

-   **Name/ID:** A unique name or identifier for the persona (e.g.
    `"Cybersecurity Executive - CISO (Portuguese)"`). This is mostly for
    reference.
-   **Role/Job Title:** The persona's role or position, which often
    implies their perspective (e.g. *"Chief Information Security
    Officer"*, *"Finance Board Member"*, *"Software Engineer"*).
-   **Language and Locale:** The language (and possibly locale or
    culture) the persona prefers. For example, `"language": "pt-PT"` for
    a Portuguese speaker, or `"language": "en-US"` for an American
    English speaker. The service will output in this language.
-   **Domain Expertise & Knowledge Level:** What subject areas the
    persona is knowledgeable about (and to what depth) vs. areas they
    are less familiar with. This can guide what terms need explanation.
    For example:
-   `"expertise": {"cybersecurity": "high", "finance": "low"}` for a
    technical security expert who might not know finance jargon.
-   Another persona might have
    `"expertise": {"cybersecurity": "low", "finance": "high"}` if they
    are a finance executive who is not well-versed in technical
    cybersecurity concepts.
-   **Interests/Priorities:** What the persona cares about when
    receiving information. For instance, a CFO persona prioritizes
    business impact and cost, while a CISO persona prioritizes risk
    mitigation and technical details. This helps the LLM emphasize
    certain aspects of the content (financial impact, technical root
    cause, etc.) when translating or responding.
-   **Communication Style:** The tone and style preferred by the
    persona. This could include formality, brevity, and structure.
    Examples:
-   Formal vs. informal tone.
-   High-level summary vs. in-depth detail.
-   Empathetic vs. straight-to-business tone.
-   Whether they prefer visual bullet points, analogies, etc., could
    also be noted.
-   **Urgency and Frequency Preferences:** How the persona handles
    information urgency. For example, does this persona need critical
    information upfront ("bottom-line-up-front" style) because they only
    have time for headlines, or are they comfortable with a detailed
    narrative? Do they prefer immediate alerts for incidents or periodic
    summaries?
-   **Additional Context/Traits:** Any other relevant attributes, such
    as cultural context ("values transparency and honesty"),
    decision-making style, or known biases.

These fields collectively act as a **profile** that the LLM will use to
adjust its output. By feeding such persona attributes into the prompt,
the LLM can modulate its response accordingly. As one study on
persona-based prompting explains, *personas allow LLMs to adjust tone,
language complexity, and style for different user types and
preferences*, leading to more user-centered
communication[\[2\]](https://vidpros.com/llm-personas-prompting/#:~:text=Personas%20allow%20LLMs%20to%20adjust,centered%2C%20building%20trust%20and%20rapport).
The persona profile effectively tells the model "here's your audience or
role, adapt to them."

**Example Persona Definition (JSON):**

    {
      "id": "persona_ciso_pt",  
      "name": "CISO of ACME Corp (Portuguese)",  
      "role": "Chief Information Security Officer",  
      "language": "pt-PT",  
      "expertise": {
        "cybersecurity": "expert",
        "finance": "basic"
      },  
      "priorities": ["cyber risk reduction", "incident response", "technical accuracy"],  
      "communication_style": {
        "tone": "professional",
        "detail_level": "high",
        "style": "direct and technical"
      },  
      "urgency_preference": "immediate updates on major incidents"
    }

Another example might be a **Board Executive persona** in English:

    {
      "id": "persona_board_exec_en",  
      "name": "Board Member (Finance)",  
      "role": "CFO, Board of Directors",  
      "language": "en-UK",  
      "expertise": {
        "cybersecurity": "low",
        "finance": "expert"
      },
      "priorities": ["business impact", "regulatory compliance", "reputation risk"],  
      "communication_style": {
        "tone": "formal",
        "detail_level": "summary-focused",
        "style": "business-centric and concise"
      },
      "urgency_preference": "focus on key points first, follow-up details if needed"
    }

These are illustrative; the schema can be refined. The key is that the
persona profile provides enough information for the LLM to **infer how
to present or interpret information** for that persona. The service will
likely maintain a schema definition to validate persona objects. It may
also include a version or timestamp if we plan to update personas over
time.

**Persona Storage and Retrieval:** Since the Personas service itself is
stateless, persona definitions are not permanently stored in the service
instance. Instead, persona data can be:

-   **Provided directly in the request** (as a JSON payload or
    reference). A client can include the full persona object with each
    API call that needs it.
-   **Referenced by an ID/URL:** The service could accept a reference
    (like an ID or a URL) to fetch the persona definition from an
    external source (e.g., a database, an object storage link, or a
    separate "persona registry" service). For example,
    `persona_id: "persona_ciso_pt"` could be resolved by the service via
    a known config store or HTTP GET from a given URL that returns the
    JSON. We will leverage existing **OSBot/TypeSafe** configuration
    mechanisms if available, so that the service can fetch and safely
    use persona data without maintaining state internally.
-   The use of type-safe primitives and careful input handling will
    ensure that persona definitions (which might contain natural
    language descriptions) do not inadvertently introduce
    prompt-injection or malformed prompts. Essentially, the persona
    fields will be encoded or inserted into the LLM prompt in a
    controlled manner (e.g., as a structured system prompt or via a
    template) so that the model interprets them as context, not as user
    instructions.

## Service Modes of Operation

The Personas Service offers two primary modes of operation,
corresponding to two ways of using a persona profile with the LLM: **(1)
Translate to Persona, and (2) Respond as Persona.** These fulfill
different needs in the communication workflow.

### 1. Translate *to* Persona (Persona as Audience)

In this mode, the service **takes an input message and rewrites or
translates it for the target persona**. The assumption is that the input
content is written from a general or original perspective, and we want
to tailor it so that the target persona will understand it fully and be
addressed appropriately. Essentially, this treats the persona as the
*audience/recipient* of the message.

-   **Input:** The client provides a piece of content (text) that needs
    to be translated for the persona, along with the persona definition
    (or an ID for it). For example, an input might be: *"There's been a
    ransomware incident in Division X that is impacting the P&L
    statement."*
-   **Operation:** The service will construct a prompt to the LLM that
    says, in effect, "Rephrase or explain this message in a way that
    \[Persona X\] would understand and find relevant." It will embed the
    persona's attributes (language, expertise, etc.) into the prompt as
    context. The underlying LLM (via the `llms.mgraph.ai` backend) will
    generate a rewritten version of the content tailored to the persona.
-   **Output:** A transformed version of the message, addressed to the
    persona. The output will be in the persona's language and pitched at
    the right level of detail and tone.

**Example:** Consider the message about a ransomware incident affecting
profit & loss.\
- For the **CISO persona (Portuguese, cybersecurity expert)**, the
original terms like "ransomware" are well-understood (no need to explain
what ransomware means), but business terms like "P&L" might be
unfamiliar. The service might output (in Portuguese) a message that
still calls it "ransomware" but perhaps clarifies "impacting the
financial results (lucros e perdas)" since P&L might need expansion. It
would also likely include technical details (since a CISO would want to
know specifics of the incident) and be fairly direct about the
cybersecurity aspects.\
- For the **Board Executive persona (English, finance expert)**, the
service would do the opposite: it might not bother explaining "P&L"
(because a CFO knows it means Profit and Loss), but it would explain
"ransomware" in more accessible terms (e.g. "a type of cyber attack that
encrypts data and demands a ransom"). The tone would be high-level,
focusing on business impact ("it has caused downtime in Division X and
could affect Q4 financials") rather than technical minutiae. It might be
more formal and include a suggestion of actions or reassurances, fitting
how one would brief a board member.

These tailored outputs ensure each persona gets the information in the
way that makes sense to them. If the same original message is run
through `Translate to Persona` for multiple personas, we get multiple
versions, each appropriate for its audience. This is extremely useful in
scenarios like incident communication, where different stakeholders (IT
teams, executives, customers) must all be informed with the same base
facts but with different emphasis.

From an implementation standpoint, `translate` mode will typically use a
prompt pattern like:

> *System prompt:* "You are an assistant that helps translate messages
> for specific audiences."\
> *Instruction:* "Please translate/reframe the following message for
> **\[PersonaName\]**, who is a **\[persona role and traits\]**. The
> output should be in **\[PersonaLanguage\]** and communicated in a
> style appropriate for this persona."\
> *Original message:* "...(the content)...".

We will fine-tune the exact prompt for optimal results. The LLM will
then produce the rewritten message.

### 2. Respond *as* Persona (Persona as Speaker)

In this mode, the service enables clients to **ask a question or present
a scenario, and get an answer as if the persona itself is responding**.
Here, the persona serves as the *speaker or responder*. This effectively
lets the LLM role-play as the persona, using the persona's knowledge and
communication style to generate an answer or commentary.

-   **Input:** A user query or prompt that the persona should respond
    to, plus the persona definition (or reference). For example, a query
    might be: *"What are the biggest concerns from this ransomware
    incident?"* and the persona could be the Board Executive.
-   **Operation:** The service will prompt the LLM with the persona's
    profile and instruct it to answer the query in the first person (or
    appropriate voice) of that persona. Essentially: "Imagine you are
    \[Persona X\]. Given the following question/situation, provide the
    response **as if you are Persona X**, using their knowledge, tone,
    and perspective."
-   **Output:** A response or answer text generated by the LLM, written
    in the persona's voice or viewpoint. It should reflect the persona's
    priorities and expertise.

**Example:** Using the same ransomware scenario:\
- If we ask *"How should we handle this incident?"* and choose the
**CISO persona**, the **Respond as Persona** mode would yield an answer
that a typical CISO might give. In Portuguese (since that persona's
language is pt-PT), it might say: "*Como CISO, minha recomendação é
primeiro isolarmos os sistemas afetados pelo ransomware, em seguida
\...*" and go on to detail technical incident response steps, perhaps
referencing security teams, forensics, etc. The answer would be detailed
and action-oriented from a security standpoint.\
- If we instead ask the **Board Executive persona** the same question,
the response might come as a formal statement in English, like: "*From a
board perspective, I would want to ensure that our response team is
containing the incident and that we have engaged cybersecurity experts.
Our priority is to minimize financial and reputational impact...*". This
answer would be less technical, more strategic, and may include a
request for frequent updates or assurance that stakeholders (investors,
regulators) are kept informed -- reflecting a board-level concern.

This **Respond as Persona** capability can be used to simulate
conversations with different roles. It's akin to having an expert or
stakeholder "speak" via the LLM. For instance, a development team could
ask "What would the CFO think about investing in this new security
software?" and get a plausible answer crafted in a CFO-like tone. It's a
powerful way to anticipate questions or viewpoints from various
personas. It also overlaps with the concept of persona-based chatbots
(where the chatbot has a fixed persona).

The prompt structure for this mode will be something like:

> *System prompt:* "You are impersonating \[PersonaName\] --
> \[PersonaDescription\]. Answer user queries as this persona."\
> *User prompt:* "\<the user's question or statement\>" (which might
> include scenario details).

The LLM then produces the persona's answer. We will ensure the prompt
includes all relevant persona info so that the model stays in character
(e.g. using first person if appropriate: "I, as \[role\], think that..."
or simply a knowledgeable tone).

### Chaining Both Modes (Double Translation Workflow)

It's worth noting that these two modes can be combined in sequence for
optimal communication loops. For example, one could **first use
Translate-to-Persona** to tailor a message for a persona, then **use
Respond-as-Persona** by feeding that translated message to get the
persona's hypothetical reply. This two-step exchange ensures that the
persona fully "understands" the initial message as it was intended.

In fact, a suggested best practice is:\
- Take an important piece of information, translate it to the target
persona's framing, then - Immediately have the persona respond (perhaps
asking clarifying questions or acknowledging).

If the persona's response seems off or indicates misunderstanding, it's
a signal that the translation might need adjustment. Ideally, though, by
using the persona's own terminology and context in the first step, the
persona (in the second step) will easily comprehend and respond
appropriately. This loop can improve clarity of communication across
knowledge domains.

## Architecture and Integration

The Personas Service will be implemented as a lightweight web service
(e.g., a Python FastAPI or Node.js Express service, given our stack
preferences) that exposes RESTful endpoints or an API for the above
functionalities. Key architectural considerations:

-   **Stateless Design:** As mentioned, each API call is independent.
    Any needed context (like persona details or conversation history)
    must be supplied in the request. The service itself will not store
    session data. This statelessness allows easy scaling (we can run
    multiple instances behind a load balancer) and aligns with cloud
    deployment on AWS Lambda or
    containers[\[1\]](https://dzone.com/articles/reliable-llm-microservices-kubernetes-aws#:~:text=).
    If longer conversations are needed, the client would have to manage
    the conversation context (possibly by including past Q&A as part of
    the prompt or using the underlying LLM service's features).

-   **Endpoints:** We anticipate endpoints such as:

-   `POST /translate` -- for Translate-to-Persona mode. The payload
    would include either a persona ID or full persona data, and the
    message to translate. It returns the translated message.

-   `POST /respond` -- for Respond-as-Persona mode. Payload includes
    persona info and the user's query or prompt. Returns the persona's
    answer.

-   `POST /persona` (or `/personas`) -- for creating a new persona
    profile. This could accept a JSON definition to store (if we
    maintain a store or forward it to a config service). Given
    statelessness, this might actually call an underlying config storage
    (like an AWS DynamoDB or our OSBot config) to save the persona.
    Alternatively, the client might just manage persona JSON externally
    and not store on the service at all, using this endpoint only to
    validate schema or to run LLM-assisted generation (see next point).

-   `PUT /persona/{id}` -- update an existing persona definition (if
    storing).

-   `GET /persona/{id}` -- retrieve a persona definition (if we
    implement a store).

-   These are optional if we decide the service itself won't permanently
    hold personas. They could be omitted in favor of managing personas
    elsewhere, with the service just consuming them.

-   **Persona Creation via LLM (Optional Enhancement):** A special
    endpoint like `POST /persona/generate` could take a description or
    requirements in natural language and utilize the LLM to produce a
    draft persona JSON. For example, one could POST:
    `{"description": "A persona of a CTO who is very technical, prefers brief summaries, and speaks French."}`
    and the service would call the LLM to fill out a persona template
    (role: CTO, language: French, likely high tech expertise, etc.).
    This is a convenience feature to help define personas without
    manually writing JSON. The returned JSON can then be reviewed and
    refined by the user. This feature again uses the existing LLM
    backend and prompt engineering: e.g., *"Given the following
    description, output a JSON persona profile matching our schema."*

-   **Integration with LLM Backend:** The service will act as a client
    to the `llms.prod.mgraph.ai` service. That backend presumably
    provides a unified API to various LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, etc.). Our
    service will format requests to it, likely including: a system
    prompt (with persona context), the user prompt or content, and any
    parameters (like temperature, max tokens). It will then receive the
    LLM's generated text and forward that back to the caller. We must
    handle errors from the LLM service (network issues, model errors,
    token limits, etc.) and return appropriate error responses or
    fallbacks. Since our service logic is relatively simple (prompt
    construction and forwarding), the main errors will be from upstream
    or input validation.

-   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting the right prompts is crucial for
    quality output. We will maintain prompt templates for each mode. For
    example, for translate mode: *"Act as a communications expert
    translating for \[persona description\]..."*, and for respond mode:
    *"Act as \[persona name\] and respond to this query..."*. We will
    likely include the persona's data in the system prompt so that the
    model always has that context. The user's actual message or question
    will be the user prompt part. We must ensure the model's output is
    in the correct language (we can explicitly instruct the language).

-   **Type Safety and Security:** If using the OSBot Type-Safe
    primitives, we will ensure that when inserting user-provided strings
    (like the content to translate), we quote or otherwise neutralize
    any special tokens that could be misinterpreted as prompt
    instructions. The persona service should also sanitize or limit any
    persona definitions if they come from untrusted sources, to avoid
    malicious personas that could hijack the prompt (this is a form of
    prompt-injection prevention by not blindly concatenating strings).
    Using a structured approach (like inserting persona fields in a
    JSON-like format or clearly labeling them in the system prompt) can
    help the model distinguish persona metadata from conversation
    content.

-   **Performance:** The service itself will have minimal overhead (just
    JSON parsing, a possible fetch of persona data, and the LLM API
    call). The heavy lifting is the LLM inference which happens in the
    backend service. We should design with concurrency in mind (allow
    multiple requests to be processed in parallel if the backend can
    handle it). If needed, we might implement a simple cache for recent
    translations or responses to avoid duplicate LLM calls, but given
    that persona outputs are highly context-specific, caching may have
    limited use except in repeated identical queries. Logging and
    monitoring should be in place to track usage and latency.

-   **AWS Deployment:** We expect to deploy this as a container or
    serverless function on AWS. The lack of state means we don't need a
    database for core functionality (unless we add an internal store for
    personas). We will use environment configuration for things like the
    URL/credentials of the LLM backend, and possibly for specifying
    where to retrieve persona definitions if by reference (e.g., an S3
    bucket or a config API). The service will be accessible at
    `personas.prod.mgraph.ai` (behind authentication if required, or
    within a VPC if it's internal).

## Usage Example Walk-through

To illustrate how everything comes together, let's walk through a
realistic usage scenario step by step:

**Scenario:** There has been a security incident (ransomware attack) at
a company. The technical incident report is written in a very IT-focused
way. We need to communicate this to two stakeholders: Alice (the CISO of
a subsidiary, who speaks Portuguese and is very technical) and Bob (a
board member/CFO, who is English-speaking and non-technical). We'll use
the Personas Service to generate the communications.

1.  **Defining Personas:** Suppose we have pre-defined persona profiles
    for Alice and Bob. Alice's persona (ID `persona_ciso_pt`) and Bob's
    persona (ID `persona_board_exec_en`) are stored in our system or
    available as JSON. If not already defined, we could create them via
    the service:

2.  We call `POST /persona` with Alice's details (as per earlier example
    JSON). Similarly for Bob. The service either stores them or returns
    an ID for immediate use. *(If the service is truly stateless and not
    storing, we skip this step and just prepare the JSON in our
    client.)*

3.  **Translating the Incident Report:** The original incident report
    text might be: *"Division X experienced a ransomware attack
    compromising several servers. The attack has impacted the P&L ---
    financial reporting for Q4 might be delayed. Technical teams are
    working to contain the malware and restore backups."*

4.  To generate Alice's version, we call `POST /translate` with
    `persona_id = persona_ciso_pt` (or the full persona JSON for Alice)
    and the above text.

5.  The Personas Service fetches Alice's persona definition (if given by
    ID), then creates a prompt for the LLM: "Translate the following for
    \[Alice's persona details\]" + original text.

6.  The LLM returns a Portuguese response, perhaps: *"A Divisão X sofreu
    um ataque de* *ransomware* *que comprometeu vários servidores. Este
    ataque afetou os resultados (lucros e perdas) --- pode haver um
    atraso nos relatórios financeiros do Q4. As equipas técnicas estão a
    trabalhar para conter o malware e restaurar os backups."*
    -   Notice it kept the word ransomware (no need to explain to
        Alice), but it translated P&L to a phrase "resultados (lucros e
        perdas)" to clarify for a Portuguese reader. It's detailed yet
        in a professional tone.

7.  For Bob's version, we call `POST /translate` with
    `persona_id = persona_board_exec_en` and the same original text.

8.  The LLM might return an English output aimed at an executive:
    *"Division X has suffered a ransomware cyber-attack affecting
    several servers. This has impacted our operations and potentially
    the Q4 profit-and-loss statements. Our IT team is actively
    containing the attack and working to restore data from backups. We
    will likely experience some downtime, but mitigation efforts are
    underway to protect financial reporting."*

    -   In Bob's version, jargon like "ransomware" is briefly framed as
        "cyber-attack," and the significance (impact on operations and
        reporting) is highlighted. It's written in a slightly more
        explanatory and reassured tone for an executive audience.

9.  **Review and Send:** The translated messages for Alice and Bob can
    now be sent to them. Each will receive a communication that is
    immediately understandable and relevant to their perspective. Alice
    gets the info in her language with technical details; Bob gets a
    high-level English briefing with business context.

10. **Optional -- Persona Response:** Suppose we want to know how Alice
    (the CISO) might respond or what questions she might have. We can
    take the message we sent her and ask the service to respond as
    Alice.

11. Call `POST /respond` with `persona_id = persona_ciso_pt` and input:
    "\<The translated message we gave Alice\> \\n\\n What is your
    response or what actions will you take?" (or simply assume she read
    it and ask the persona for comments).

12. The service will have the LLM role-play Alice. The output might be a
    response in Portuguese like: *"Obrigado pelo aviso. Vou assegurar-me
    de que a nossa equipa de segurança em Portugal está pronta para
    ajudar e que revisamos imediatamente os nossos sistemas em busca de
    sinais semelhantes de ataque. Por favor, mantenha-me atualizado
    sobre o progresso e qualquer impacto financeiro confirmado."*

13. This shows the persona (Alice) acknowledging the info and outlining
    steps (ensuring her team is on alert, requesting updates on impact).
    This kind of simulation can be useful to anticipate needs or
    follow-ups from that persona.

14. **Lifecycle:** After usage, since the service is stateless, it
    doesn't retain anything about this interaction. If another incident
    occurs, the same steps can be repeated. New personas can be added at
    any time by defining new JSON profiles and using them in requests.
    The existing LLM backend can be scaled as usage grows, and because
    each request is independent, we can easily distribute load.

## Considerations and Future Enhancements

-   **Accuracy and Validation:** The quality of outputs depends on the
    LLM's understanding from the prompts. We should test with various
    persona profiles and content to ensure the instructions are followed
    (e.g., the model indeed uses the correct language and
    simplifies/explains as expected). Some iteration on prompt wording
    is expected. Additionally, it might be wise to include a
    post-processing step to verify language (for example, ensure no
    English leaks into a Portuguese answer for Alice's case). The
    service could detect language mismatches or ask the LLM explicitly
    to only output in the target language.

-   **Security:** As this service deals with potentially sensitive
    internal messages (like incident reports), it should enforce
    authentication/authorization such that only authorized systems or
    users can call it (especially if it's exposed as an API). Also,
    careful logging (without storing raw sensitive content) should be
    practiced. LLM prompts and responses might be logged for debugging
    but possibly need to be sanitized or kept secure.

-   **Persona Library and UI:** In the future, we might build a small UI
    or repository for managing persona profiles (so non-developers can
    create/edit personas easily). For now, JSON definitions suffice for
    a backend service.

-   **No Custom Model but Possible Fine-Tuning:** While initially we
    commit to no custom models, if the persona translations become a
    heavily used feature, one could consider fine-tuning a model or
    using retrieval-augmented generation to improve consistency (for
    example, ensuring certain terms are always translated a specific way
    for a persona). However, this is outside the current scope and
    likely unnecessary given powerful general models available.

-   **Multi-Persona or Group Communication:** This service currently
    focuses on one persona at a time. An interesting extension later
    could be handling **multiple personas in one go** (for instance,
    produce outputs for *all* relevant personas for an incident). The
    client can of course loop through personas, but a batch call might
    be convenient. Additionally, we could simulate a round-table
    discussion by cycling through `respond as persona` with different
    personas to emulate a conversation (though managing that is more
    complex).

-   **Citations and Fact-Checking:** If the content being translated
    contains factual data or specific terms, the LLM should ideally not
    hallucinate or alter facts during translation. Prompting should
    emphasize "do not change the factual content, only rephrase". In
    testing, we must verify that numerical data or specific names remain
    correct in the output.

## Conclusion

The Personas Service will fill a valuable role in making communication
across diverse stakeholders more efficient and tailored. By harnessing
LLM capabilities in a stateless microservice, we enable on-demand
personalization of messages -- whether it's simplifying technical jargon
for executives or adding technical depth for experts, and switching
languages or tones as needed. Persona-driven communication has been
shown to increase engagement and clarity, as the messaging is aligned
with the audience's
expectations[\[2\]](https://vidpros.com/llm-personas-prompting/#:~:text=Personas%20allow%20LLMs%20to%20adjust,centered%2C%20building%20trust%20and%20rapport).
Our service will provide a programmatic way to achieve this alignment.

In summary, **the Personas Service allows any application or workflow to
"speak the language" of its target personas**, without manual re-writing
for each audience. It uses the power of large language models to do the
heavy lifting of translation and rephrasing, following persona profiles
that capture the essence of who the audience or speaker is. This not
only saves time but ensures consistency and appropriateness of
communications across an organization. By keeping the service stateless
and leveraging existing LLM infrastructure, we also ensure that it is
scalable, maintainable, and easy to integrate into our ecosystem (e.g.,
hooking into incident response tools, report generators, chat
interfaces, etc.).

Going forward, developers and LLM engineers working on this service
should focus on robust prompt engineering, thorough testing with
different personas, and a simple API design for ease of use. With those
in place, **personas.prod.mgraph.ai** will become a key component for
persona-aware AI interactions within our platform, enabling more
effective and nuanced communication powered by AI.
